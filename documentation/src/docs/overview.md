This documentation describes the connector API and usage to read and write [Pravega](http://pravega.io/) streams with [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).

Build end-to-end stream processing and batch pipelines that use Pravega as the stream storage and message bus, and Apache Spark for computation over the streams.

## Features & Highlights

  - **Exactly-once processing guarantees** for both Reader and Writer, supporting **end-to-end exactly-once processing pipelines**
  - A Spark micro-batch reader connector allows Spark streaming applications to read Pravega Streams.
    Pravega stream cuts (i.e. offsets) are used to reliably recover from failures and provide exactly-once semantics.
  - A Spark batch reader connector allows Spark batch applications to read Pravega Streams.
  - A Spark writer allows Spark batch and streaming applications to write to Pravega Streams.
    Writes are optionally contained within Pravega transactions, providing exactly-once semantics.
  - Seamless integration with Spark's checkpoints.
  - Parallel Readers and Writers supporting high throughput and low latency processing.
